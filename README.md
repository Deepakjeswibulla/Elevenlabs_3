# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to **implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression** using the Housing Price Prediction dataset.  
We will train a regression model, evaluate its performance using standard metrics, and visualize the results.

---

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset used: [Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. Import and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a **Linear Regression** model using `sklearn.linear_model`.
4. Evaluate the model with:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
5. Plot regression line & interpret coefficients.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures average magnitude of errors.
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Penalizes larger errors.
- **R² Score:** Indicates how well data fits the regression model.

---

## 🖼 Visualizations
- Regression line for simple regression.
- Scatter plots of actual vs predicted values.
- Distribution of residuals.

## 💡 Interview Questions
1. What assumptions does linear regression make?  
2. How do you interpret the coefficients?  
3. What is R² score and its significance?  
4. When would you prefer MSE over MAE?  
5. How do you detect multicollinearity?  
6. Difference between simple & multiple regression?  
7. Can linear regression be used for classification?  
8. What happens if regression assumptions are violated?
